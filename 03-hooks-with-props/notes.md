# Hooks with Props

Also referred to as "Prop Collections and Getters" (Kent C. Dodds).

Examples:

- Downshift useCombobox
  https://www.downshift-js.com/use-combobox

- React Aria Hooks
  https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useMenu.html

Where is this pattern really useful?

Library creates where you apply lots of props and especially aria attributes.
Otherwise people will just leave them out and you get a worse experience than necessary with a small API change.
