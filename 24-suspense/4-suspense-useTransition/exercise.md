# Exercise

1. Go into `App.tsx` and enable `useTransition` code. Make sure to replace the existing buttons with the buttons using the `startTransition` function. Investigate the effects it has when switching between different profiles.

2. Play with the timeout configuration if `useTransition`.

**Hint**: Slow down the network performance to see the effect. In Chrome/Brave developers tools under the "Performance" tab you can switch network to "Fast 3G"
